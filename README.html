    <h1>T3: Todo-list / Time / Tracker</h1>
    <p>This project is a command-line utility to keep track of your projects. It
      is written in Python3. I got the project from
      https://github.com/j-adamski/T3-Todo-List-Time-Tracker,&nbsp; and made
      some changes. All the *.md files came from that project. The reason for
      not continuing with the original project is that some of the changes
      affect the format of the tasks.json file, so the two versions are not
      compatible.</p>
    <p>A <strong>project</strong> is a list of <strong>tasks</strong>. A
      project can have only one task. Tasks have names, a timeSpent attribute, a
      timeStamp attribute, and a completed attribute. In terms of Python data
      structures, a task is a dictionary, with task attributes corresponding to
      keys.</p>
    <p>To run the program, use </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="font-family: monospace;">python3
        t3.py</strong><em> arguments</em></p>
    <p>At the moment, the following work (the first line assumes the command t3
      runs t3.py)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-family: monospace;">t3
          --report all</span></strong> <br>
      <strong><span style="font-family: monospace;">python3 t3.py --report all</span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # if not installed</p>
    <p>lists all your projects and, within each project, the tasks. Internally,
      t3Report() is called.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-family: monospace;">t3
          --add projectname task1 task2 ... taskN</span></strong>:</p>
    <p>This creates the project and listed tasks. If no tasks are listed, one is
      created with name "maintask". If projectname already exists, then the
      tasks are added if they do not exist already. Any tasks that do already
      exist are ignored.</p>
    <p>All data is stored in a file tasks.json, in directory tasks. (This is
      awkward; eventually the tasks.json should be in a designated place
      relative to the user's "home" directory.) If tasks/tasks.json is not
      found, <em>the program will abort with an error</em>.</p>
    <p>At the top level, this file is a directory with 't3' as a single key. So,
      if you read the json file into a Python data structure S, you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>S['t3'] is the project <strong>dictionary</strong>: a map from
        project names to <strong>lists</strong> of tasks</li>
      <li>If P is in S['t3'].keys(), then P is the string name of a project, and
        L = S['t3'][P] is a <strong>list</strong> of tasks</li>
      <li>Each element of L is a dictionary representing a specific task, with
        L['taskname'] as the task's name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As of now, the code to do the following does not work:</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --complete project</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      /&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --complete project
        task1 ... taskN</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --delete project</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      /&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;"> t3 --delete project
        task1 ... taskN</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --start project</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      /&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --start project
        task</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --stop project</span>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3
        --stop project task</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">t3 --edit</span></p>
    <p>The goal here is to make this into a workable project. The code needs to
      be completed, important features need to be identified, installation
      should be cleared up, and usability issues (eg the location of tasks.json)
      should be resolved.<br>
